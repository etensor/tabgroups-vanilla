**Missing:**
 > * Click on local file to open: No permissions.
 > >  â†³ Open as Group will work though.
 > * Deleting an entry from a group.
 > * Open group in a new window, or a native tabGroup.
 > * Lazy Loading the opened group.
 > * Fetching site favicon on manual entry.
 > * Would be nice to be able to sync it with other devices.

If you can help me implement the lazy loading functionality or any other awesome feature, that would be nice and very welcomed.
